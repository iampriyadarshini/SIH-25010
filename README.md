## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The solution is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile app or chatbot for farmers. It integrates inputs from soil sensors, weather APIs, satellite imagery, and local crop histories.

Key features:

Personalized crop advisories based on soil, weather, crop history, and real-time field data.

Pest/disease detection using image uploads and AI for early identification and actionable guidance.

Soil health monitoring via IoT sensors, with recommendations for input usage, fertilizer choice, and irrigation schedules.

Market price tracking for various crops, connected to local mandis and price APIs.

Weather alerts and predictive insights for disaster and risk management.

Voice support and multilingual interface for accessibility, especially for low-literate users.

Continuous feedback loop to collect farmer experiences and refine recommendations.

Offline support for regions with poor connectivity.

## Technical Approach
AI/ML Algorithms: Use Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for crop and fertilizer recommendations.

IoT Soil Sensors: Real-time capture of moisture, temperature, and nutrient status.

Satellite Imaging: For crop health tracking and early risk warnings.

Data Integration: Combine government datasets, local agronomy research, and real-time field data.

Multilingual UI/Voice: Native language support for advisories and voice responses.

Mobile/Web Apps & WhatsApp: Available as direct apps and chatbot integrations.

## Feasibility and Viability
Technologically proven: Existing systems like Farmonaut, Crop Doctor, and DeHaat show success using similar approaches in India.

Scalable: Can start regionally then expand nationally.

Challenges: Ensuring device penetration, local data accuracy, and farmer trust; mitigated by partnerships with local extension officers/NGOs and ongoing training.
## Impact and Benefits
Increases yields by 20–30%, proven in prior ICT-based initiatives.

Reduces unnecessary input costs and mitigates environmental damage.

Empowers small and marginal farmers, directly addressing food security and sustainable farming.

Socioeconomic upliftment: Higher returns for farmers, leading to better community outcomes.
